### Problem: Control the water inside a water tank (with leakage flow)

- P controller: ![alt text](https://github.com/threezinedine/control-theory-simulation/blob/main/images/p_image.png)
  + cannot reach the desired value
- PI controller: ![alt text](https://github.com/threezinedine/control-theory-simulation/blob/main/images/pid_image.png)
  + with an I component -> can reach the desired value
